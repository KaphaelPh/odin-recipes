        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macaroni salad is a classic, creamy side dish that’s perfect for picnics, barbecues, or as a quick, easy addition to any meal. Made with cooked elbow macaroni as the base, it’s typically mixed with a combination of crunchy vegetables like celery, onion, and bell peppers, all tossed in a smooth, tangy dressing. The dressing often consists of mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and a hint of sugar for balance, though variations may include sour cream or yogurt for added creaminess. For added flavor, ingredients such as hard-boiled eggs, pickles, or herbs like parsley are sometimes incorporated.</p>
        <p>The versatility of macaroni salad allows for many customizations, making it easy to tailor to personal tastes. Whether kept simple or spruced up with extras like ham, cheese, or tuna, this dish always brings a refreshing balance of textures and flavors. Best served chilled, it is a comforting, crowd-pleasing dish that's easy to prepare in advance.</p>
