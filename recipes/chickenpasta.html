        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Jerk Chicken Rasta Pasta is a vibrant and flavorful fusion dish that brings together the bold, spicy heat of jerk seasoning with the creamy, savory richness of pasta. The dish starts with tender, marinated jerk chicken—seasoned with a mix of allspice, thyme, garlic, and Scotch bonnet peppers—that is either grilled or pan-seared for a smoky, charred finish. The pasta, typically fettuccine or penne, is cooked until al dente and then coated in a creamy sauce infused with Caribbean flavors like coconut milk or heavy cream, bell peppers, and scallions. The contrasting elements of spicy, charred chicken and the smooth, creamy pasta create a delicious balance of flavors, while the vibrant colors of red, yellow, and green bell peppers give a nod to Rastafarian culture, adding to the dish’s visual appeal.</p>
        <p>This dish is perfect for those who love both comfort food and a bit of a spicy kick. It's not only hearty but also offers a satisfying mix of textures and flavors—tender chicken, velvety sauce, and perfectly cooked pasta—all finished with fresh herbs and sometimes a hint of Parmesan for added richness. Jerk Chicken Rasta Pasta is a delightful way to enjoy Caribbean flavors in a creative, fusion-style meal that’s both comforting and exciting.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons jerk seasoning</li>
            <li>1 lime (juiced)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>12 oz fettuccine or penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream (or coconut milk)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (grated)</li>
            <li>1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 green bell pepper (sliced)</li>
            <li>2-3 green onions (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken breasts with jerk seasoning, lime juice, and olive oil. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for more flavor).</li>
            <li>Grill or pan-sear the marinated chicken over medium-high heat for 6-8 minutes per side, or until fully cooked. Set aside to rest, then slice.</li>
            <li>Boil the pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside. </li>
            <li>In the same pan used for the chicken, add a bit more olive oil and sauté the sliced bell peppers, green onions, and garlic until soft, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream (or coconut milk) and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Simmer on low heat until the sauce thickens, about 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Top with sliced jerk chicken and garnish with extra green onions or Parmesan if desired. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
